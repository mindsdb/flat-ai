You gotta give it a \"prompt\" - fancy word for \"given some context {context}, please do something with this text, oh mighty AI overlord.\" But here's the optimization: constantly writing the code to pass the context to an LLM is like telling your grandparents how to use a smartphone... every. single. day. \n",

    "- `add_context`: Stack more stuff on top, like a context burrito\n",
    "- `clear_context`: For when you want the LLM to forget everything, like the last 10 minutes of your life ;)\n",
    "- `delete_from_context`: Surgical removal of specific memories\n",
